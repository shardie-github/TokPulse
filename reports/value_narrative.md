# TokPulse Value Narrative & Messaging

## Core Value Proposition

**"Increase Shopify store sales by 20%+ with AI-powered product recommendations that work with any theme."**

## Problem Statement

### The Pain
- **67% of online shoppers** abandon carts because they can't find what they're looking for
- **Average e-commerce conversion rate** is only 2.86%
- **Merchants lose $18 billion annually** to cart abandonment
- **Existing recommendation tools** are complex, expensive, or don't work with all themes

### The Cost
- Every 1% increase in conversion rate = 10% increase in revenue
- Poor product discovery = lost customers and lower lifetime value
- Manual recommendation setup = hours of technical work
- Generic recommendations = low engagement and poor performance

## Solution Statement
