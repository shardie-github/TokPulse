## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:

- `feature/user-authentication`
- `fix/payment-processing-bug`
- `docs/api-documentation`

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication flow
fix(api): resolve webhook processing timeout
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Run quality checks**:
   ```bash
   pnpm quality:check
   ```
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Pull Request Template

When creating a PR, please include:

- **Description**: What changes were made and why
- **Type**: Feature, bug fix, documentation, etc.
- **Testing**: How the changes were tested
- **Breaking Changes**: Any breaking changes (if applicable)
- **Screenshots**: For UI changes
- **Checklist**: Confirm all requirements are met

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer type annotations over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types)

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use TypeScript for props and state
- Follow the component structure in existing code

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

### File Organization

- Group related functionality together
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for packages
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Follow the existing directory structure

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test --coverage
```

### E2E Tests

- Add E2E tests for critical user flows
- Use Playwright for E2E testing
- Test both happy path and error scenarios

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
pnpm e2e:install

# Run E2E tests
pnpm e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
pnpm e2e:ui
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD/BDD)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests independent and isolated

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files up to date
- Update API documentation for changes

### README Files

Each package should have a README.md with:

- Purpose and description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API reference (if applicable)
- Contributing guidelines

1. **Self-review** your code before submitting
2. **Test thoroughly** on your local machine
3. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
4. **Keep PRs focused** and reasonably sized
5. **Respond to reviews** constructively
