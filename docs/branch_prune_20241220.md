#### 3. Feature Branches (Review Required)

These branches may contain unmerged work and need review:

- `remotes/origin/feat/hardonia-scaffold-v1.3-20251005_020827`
- `remotes/origin/feat/hardonia-scaffold-v1.3-20251005_021523`
- `remotes/origin/work/termux-20250924215640`

#### 4. Current Working Branches (Keep)

These branches are currently in use and should be kept:

- `main` (primary branch)
- `housekeeping/auto/20241220-1430` (current housekeeping branch)
- `backup/20241220-pre-housekeeping` (safety backup)
- `cursor/repository-housekeeping-and-quality-pass-0e1c` (original branch)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions (Safe to Delete)

1. **Delete merged cursor branches** - All cursor/\* branches appear to be completed work
2. **Delete merged dependabot branches** - These are automated and can be recreated
3. **Clean up local branches** - Delete local copies of merged branches

### Review Required

1. **Feature branches** - Review for any unmerged work
2. **Work branches** - Check if work is complete or needs to be merged

### Branch Naming Convention

Going forward, use consistent branch naming:

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `chore/description` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

## Cleanup Commands

### Delete Local Branches

```bash
# Delete local branches that have been merged
git branch -d branch-name

# Force delete if needed
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Delete Remote Branches

```bash
# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

### Clean Up Remote References

```bash
# Prune remote references
git remote prune origin
```

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits of Pruning

- Reduced repository size
- Cleaner branch list
- Easier navigation
- Reduced confusion for contributors
- Better CI/CD performance

### Risks

- Minimal risk for merged branches
- Need to verify no unmerged work exists
- Backup branches provide safety net

## Follow-up Actions

1. **Monitor branch creation** - Ensure new branches follow naming conventions
2. **Regular cleanup** - Schedule monthly branch pruning
3. **Documentation** - Update contributing guidelines with branch management
4. **Automation** - Consider automated branch cleanup for merged branches

## Conclusion

The repository has accumulated many branches over time, primarily from automated development work. Most can be safely deleted, significantly improving repository hygiene. The recommended cleanup will reduce the branch count from 50+ to approximately 10-15 active branches.
